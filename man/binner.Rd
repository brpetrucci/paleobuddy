\title{Bin occurrences in geologic intervals}
\usage{
binner(x, bins)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector containing occurrence times for one given species.}

\item{bins}{A vector of time intervals corresponding to geological time 
ranges.}
}
\value{
A vector of occurrence counts for each interval, sorted from 
furthest to closest to zero.
}
\description{
Given a vector of fossil occurrences and time bins to represent geological
ranges, returns the occurrence counts in each bin.
}
\details{
The convention for couting occurrences inside a bin is to count
all occurrences exactly in the boundary furthest from zero and exclude
bins exactly in the boundary closest to zero. Then, in the bin closest 
to zero (i.e., the "last", or "most recent" bin), include all occurrence 
on each of the two boundaries. So occurrences that fall on a boundary are
placed on the most recent bin possible

\examples{

###
# first let us create some artificial occurrence data and check

# occurrence vector
x <- c(5.2, 4.9, 4.1, 3.2, 1, 0.2)

# bins vector
bins <- c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

# result
binnedSamp <- binner(x, bins)
binnedSamp

###
# it should work with any type of number in bins

# occurrence vector
x <- c(6.7, 5.03, 4.2, 3.4, 1.2, 0.4)

# bins vector
bins <- c(7.2, 6.7, 5.6, 4.3, 3.2, sqrt(2), 1, 0)

# result
binnedSamp <- binner(x, bins)
binnedSamp

###
# let us try with a real simulated species fossil record

# set seed
set.seed(1)

# run the simulation
sim <- bd.sim(1, lambda = 0.1, mu = 0.05, tMax = 15)

# sample it
sampled <- sample.clade(sim = sim, rho = 1, tMax = 15, S = 1)$SampT

# bins vector
bins <- c(15.1, 12.3, 10, 7.1, 5.8, 3.4, 2.2, 0)

# result
binnedsample <- binner(sampled, bins)
binnedsample
