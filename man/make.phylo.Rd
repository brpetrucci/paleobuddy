\usage{
make.phylo(sim, fossils = NULL, returnRootTime = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{A \code{sim} object, containing extinction times, speciation times,
parent, and status information for each species in the simulation. See 
\code{?sim}.}

\item{fossils}{A data frame with a \code{"Species"} column and a
\code{SampT} column, usually an output of the \code{sample.clade}
function. Species names must contain only one number each, corresponding
to the order of the \code{sim} vectors.}

\item{returnRootTime}{Logical indicating if phylo should have information
regarding \code{root.time}. If set to \code{NULL} (default), returned 
phylogenies will not have \code{root.time} if there is at least one extant 
lineage in the sim object. If there are only extinct lineages in the 
\code{sim} object and it is set to \code{NULL}, \code{root.time} will be 
returned. If set to \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}, \code{root.time} will be 
removed or forced into the phylo object, respectively. In this case, we 
highly recommend users to read about the behavior of some functions (such as
APE's \code{axisPhylo}) when this argument is forced.}
}
\value{
A \code{phylo} object from the APE package. Tip labels are numbered
following the order of species in the \code{sim} object. If fossil 
occurrence data was supplied, the tree will include fossil occurrences as 
tips with branch length \code{0}, bifurcating at its sampling time from the 
corresponding species' edge (i.e. a sampled ancestor tree). Note that to 
obtain a true sampled ancestor (SA) tree, one must perform the last step of 
deleting tips that are not either extant or fossil occurrences (i.e. the 
tips at true time of extinction). 

Note this package does not depend on APE (Paradis et al, 2004) since it is 
never used inside its functions, but it is suggested since one might want to
manipulate the phylogenies generated by this function.

\description{
Generates a phylogeny from a \code{sim} object containing speciation and 
extinction times, parent and status information (see \code{?sim}). Returns a
\code{phylo} object containing information on the phylogeny, following an 
"evolutionary Hennigian" (sensu Ezard et al 2011) format (i.e., a 
bifurcating tree). Takes an optional argument encoding fossil occurrences to
return a sampled ancestor tree (see references). This tree consists of the
original tree, plus the fossil occurrences added as branches of length 
\code{0} branching off of the corresponding species at the time of 
occurrence. Such trees can be used, as is or with small modifications, as
starting trees in phylogenetic inference software that make use of the
fossilized birth-death model. Returns \code{NA} and sends a warning if the
simulation has only one lineage or if more than one species has \code{NA}
as parent (i.e. there is no single common ancestor in the simulation). In 
the latter case, please use \code{find.lineages} first.
}
\details{
When \code{root.time} is added to a phylogeny, packages such as APE
can change their interpretation of the information in the \code{phylo} 
object. For instance, a completely extinct phylogeny might be interpreted as
extant if there is no info about \code{root.time}. This might create 
misleading interpretations even with simple functions such as 
\code{ape::axisPhylo}. \code{make.phylo} tries to accommodate different 
evo/paleo practices in its default value for \code{returnRootTime} by 
automatically attributing \code{root.time} when the \code{sim} object is 
extinct. We encourage careful inspection of output if users force 
\code{make.phylo} to use a specific behavior, especially when using 
phylogenies generated by this function as input in functions from other 
packages. For extinct phylogenies, it might usually be important to 
explicitly provide information that the edge is indeed a relevant part of 
the phylogeny (for instance adding \code{root.edge = TRUE} when plotting a 
phylogeny with \code{root.time} information with \code{ape::plot.phylo}. The
last example here provides  a visualization of this issue.

\examples{

###
# we can start with a simple phylogeny

# set a simulation seed
set.seed(1) 

# simulate a BD process with constant rates
sim <- bd.sim(n0 = 1, lambda = 0.3, mu = 0.1, tMax = 10, 
             nExtant = c(2, Inf))

# make the phylogeny
phy <- make.phylo(sim)

# plot it
if (requireNamespace("ape", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # store old par settings
  oldPar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) 
  
  # change par to show phylogenies
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
  
  ape::plot.phylo(phy)
  
  # we can also plot only the molecular phylogeny
  ape::plot.phylo(ape::drop.fossil(phy))
  
  # reset par
  par(oldPar)
}

###
# this works for sim generated with any of the scenarios in bd.sim

# set seed
set.seed(1)

# simulate
sim <- bd.sim(n0 = 1, lambda = function(t) 0.2 + 0.01*t, 
             mu = function(t) 0.03 + 0.015*t, tMax = 10, 
             nExtant = c(2, Inf))

# make the phylogeny
phy <- make.phylo(sim)

# plot it
if (requireNamespace("ape", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # store old par settings
  oldPar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) 
  
  # change par to show phylogenies
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
  
  # plot phylogeny
  ape::plot.phylo(phy)
  ape::axisPhylo()
  
  # we can also plot only the molecular phylogeny
  ape::plot.phylo(ape::drop.fossil(phy))
  ape::axisPhylo()
  
  # reset par 
  par(oldPar)
}

### 
# we can use the fossils argument to generate a sample ancestors tree

# set seed
set.seed(1)

# simulate a simple birth-death process
sim <- bd.sim(n0 = 1, lambda = 0.2, mu = 0.05, tMax = 10, 
              nExtant = c(2, Inf))

# make the traditional phylogeny
phy <- make.phylo(sim)

# sample fossils
fossils <- sample.clade(sim, 0.1, 10)

# make the sampled ancestor tree
saTree <- make.phylo(sim, fossils)

# plot them
if (requireNamespace("ape", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # store old par settings
  oldPar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) 
  
  # visualize longevities and fossil occurrences
  draw.sim(sim, fossils)
  
  # change par to show phylogenies
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

  # phylogeny
  ape::plot.phylo(phy, main = "Phylogenetic tree")
  ape::axisPhylo()
  
  # sampled ancestor tree
  ape::plot.phylo(saTree, main = "Sampled Ancestor tree")
  ape::axisPhylo()
  
  # reset par
  par(oldPar)
}

### 
# finally, we can test the usage of returnRootTime

# set seed
set.seed(1)

# simulate a simple birth-death process with more than one
# species and completely extinct:
sim <- bd.sim(n0 = 1, lambda = 0.5, mu = 0.5, tMax = 10, nExtant = c(0, 0))

# make a phylogeny using default values
phy <- make.phylo(sim)

# force phylo to not have root.time info
phy_rootless <- make.phylo(sim, returnRootTime = FALSE)

# plot them
if (requireNamespace("ape", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # store old par settings
  oldPar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) 
  
  # change par to show phylogenies
  par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
  
  # if we use the default value, axisPhylo works as intended
  ape::plot.phylo(phy, root.edge = TRUE, main = "root.time default value")
  ape::axisPhylo()
  
  # note that without root.edge, we have incorrect times,
  # as APE assumes tMax was the time of first speciation
  ape::plot.phylo(phy, main = "root.edge not passed to plot.phylo")
  ape::axisPhylo()
  
  # if we force root.time to be FALSE, APE assumes the tree is
  # ultrametric, which leads to an incorrect time axis
  ape::plot.phylo(phy_rootless, main = "root.time forced as FALSE")
  ape::axisPhylo()
  # note time scale in axis
  
  # reset par
  par(oldPar)
}
