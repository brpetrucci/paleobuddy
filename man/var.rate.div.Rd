\usage{
var.rate.div(rate, t, n0 = 1, tMax = NULL, envRate = NULL, rateShifts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{The baseline function with which to make the rate.
It can be a

\describe{
\item{A number}{For constant birth-death rates.}

\item{A function of time}{For rates that vary with time. Note that this can 
be any function of time.} 

\item{A function of time and an environmental variable}{For rates varying 
with time and an environmental variable, such as temperature. Note that 
supplying a function on more than one variable without an accompanying 
\code{envRate} will result in an error.}

\item{A numeric vector}{To create step function rates. Note this must be
 accompanied by a corresponding vector of rate shift times, 
 \code{rateShifts}.}}}

\item{t}{A time vector over which to consider the distribution.}

\item{n0}{The initial number of species is by default 1, but one can change to
any nonnegative number.

Note: \code{var.rate.div} will find the expected number of daughters given a
rate \code{rate} and an initial number of parents \code{n0}, so in a
biological context \code{rate} is diversification rate, not speciation (unless
extinction is \code{0}).}

\item{tMax}{Ending time of simulation, in million years after the clade's 
origin. Needed to ensure \code{rateShifts} runs the correct way.}

\item{envRate}{A \code{data.frame} representing a time-series, usually an 
environmental variable (e.g. CO2, temperature, etc) varying with time. The 
first column of this \code{data.frame} must be time, and the second column 
must be the values of the variable. The function will return an error if 
the user supplies \code{envRate} without \code{rate} being a function of two
variables. \code{paleobuddy} has two environmental data frames, \code{temp}
and \code{co2}. One can check \code{RPANDA} for more examples.

Note that, since simulation functions are run in forward-time (i.e. with 
\code{0} being the origin time of the simulation), the time column of
\code{envRate} is assumed to do so as well, so that the row corresponding to
\code{t = 0} is assumed to be the value of the time-series when the 
simulation starts, and \code{t = tMax} is assumed to be its value when the
simulation ends (the present).

Acknowledgements: The strategy to transform a function of \code{t} and 
\code{envRate} into a function of \code{t} only using \code{envRate} was 
adapted from \code{RPANDA}.}

\item{rateShifts}{A vector indicating the time of rate shifts in a step 
function. The first element must be the first or last time point for the 
simulation, i.e. \code{0} or \code{tMax}. Since functions in paleobuddy run
from \code{0} to \code{tMax}, if \code{rateShifts} runs from past to present
(meaning \code{rateShifts[2] < rateShifts[1]}), we take 
\code{tMax - rateShifts} as the shifts vector. Note that supplying 
\code{rateShifts} when \code{rate} is not a numeric vector of the same 
length will result in an error.}
}
\value{
A vector of the expected number of species per time point supplied
in \code{t}, which can then be used to plot vs. \code{t}.
}
\description{
Calculates the expected species diversity on an interval given a (possibly time
dependent) exponential rate.  Takes as the base rate (1) a constant, (2) a 
function of time, (3) a function of time interacting with an environmental 
variable, or (4) a vector of numbers describing rates as a step function. 
Requires information regarding the maximum simulation time, and allows for 
optional extra parameters to tweak the baseline rate. For more information on
the creation of the final rate, see \code{make.rate}.

\examples{

# let us first create a vector of times to use in these examples.
time <- seq(0, 50, 0.1)

###
# we can start simple: create a constant rate
rate <- 0.1

# set this up so we see rates next to diversity
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

# see how the rate looks
r <- make.rate(0.5)
plot(time, rep(r, length(time)), type = 'l')

# get the diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')

###
# something a bit more complex: a linear rate
rate <- function(t) {
  return(0.1 - 0.005*t)
}

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')

# get the diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, t = time)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')

###
# remember: rate is diversity!

# we can create speciation...
pp <- function(t) {
  return(-0.01*t + 0.2)
}

# ...and extinction...
qq <- function(t) {
  return(0.01*t)
}

# ...and code rate as diversification
rate <- function(t) {
  return(pp(t) - qq(t))
}

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')

# get diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time, n0 = 2)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')

###
# remember: rate can be any time-varying function!

# such as a sine
rate <- function(t) {
  return(sin(t)*0.5)
}

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')

# we can have any number of starting species
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time, n0 = 2)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')

###
# we can use ifelse() to make a step function like this
rate <- function(t) {
  return(ifelse(t < 2, 0.1,
          ifelse(t < 3, 0.3,
           ifelse(t < 5, -0.2, 0.05))))
}

# change t so things are faster
time <- seq(0, 10, 0.1)

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')

# get the diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')

# important note: this method of creating a step function might be annoying,
# but when running thousands of simulations it will provide a much faster
# integration than when using our method of transforming a rates and shifts
# vector into a function of time

###
# ...which we can do as follows

# rates vector
rate <- c(0.1, 0.3, -0.2, 0.05)

# rate shifts vector
rateShifts <- c(0, 2, 3, 5)

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate, tMax = 10, rateShifts = rateShifts)
plot(time, r(time),type = 'l')
 
\dontrun{
# get the diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time, tMax = 10, rateShifts = rateShifts)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')
}

# we set it to not run due to the time this method takes. integrating a step
# function created using the methods in make.rate() is slow, as explained in
# the make.rate documentation)

# it is also impractical to supply a rate and a shifts vector and
# have an environmental dependency, so in cases where one looks to run
# more than a couple dozen simulations, and when one is looking to have a
# step function modified by an environmental variable, consider using ifelse()

# finally let us see what we can do with environmental variables

# get the temperature data
data(temp)

# diversification
rate <- function(t, env) {
  return(0.002*env)
}

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate, tMax = tMax, envRate = temp)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')


# get diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time, tMax = tMax, envRate = temp)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')

###
# we can also have a function that depends on both time AND temperature

# diversification
rate <- function(t, env) {
  return(0.02 * env - 0.001 * t)
}

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate, tMax = tMax, envRate = temp)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')

# get diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time, tMax = tMax, envRate = temp)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')
  
###
# as mentioned above, we could also use ifelse() to construct a step function
# that is modulated by temperature

# diversification
rate <- function(t, env) {
  return(ifelse(t < 2, 0.1 + 0.01*env,
          ifelse(t < 5, 0.2 - 0.005*env,
           ifelse(t < 8, 0.1 + 0.005*env, 0.08))))
}

# visualize the rate
r <- make.rate(rate, tMax = tMax, envRate = temp)
plot(time, r(time), type = 'l')

\dontrun{
# get diversity and plot it
div <- var.rate.div(rate, time, tMax = tMax, envRate = temp)
plot(time, div, type = 'l')
}

# takes a bit long so we set it to not run, but the user
# should feel free to explore this and other scenarios
