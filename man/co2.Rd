\title{Jurassic CO2 data}
\format{
A data frame with 53 rows and 2 variables:
\describe{
  \item{t}{A numeric vector representing time since the beginning of the data 
  frame age, 520 million years ago, in million years. We set this from past to 
  present as opposed to present to past since birth-death functions in 
  \code{paleobuddy} consider time going in the former direction. Hence 
  \code{t = 0} represents the time point at 520mya, while \code{t = 520} 
  represents the present.}
  
  \item{co2}{A numeric vector representing CO2 concentration as the ratio of
  CO2 mass at \code{t} over the present.}
}

\description{
CO2 data during the Jurassic. Modified from the \code{co2} set in 
\href{https://github.com/hmorlon/PANDA}{RPANDA}, originally taken from Mayhew 
et al (2008, 2012). Inverted so lower times represent time since first 
measurement, to be in line with the past-to-present convention of most
time-dependent functions in paleobuddy.
