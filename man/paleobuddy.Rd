\title{paleobuddy: Simulating diversification dynamics}
\description{
\code{paleobuddy} provides users with flexible scenarios for species 
birth-death simulations. It also provides the possibility of generating 
phylogenetic trees (with extinct and extant species) and fossil records 
(with a number of preservation scenarios) from the same underlying process.
}
\section{Birth-death simulation}{

Users have access to a large array of scenarios to use and combine for 
species birth-death simulation. The function \code{bd.sim} allows for
constant rates, rates varying as a function of time, or time and/or an 
environmental variable, as well as age-dependent rates by using a shape 
parameter from a Weibull distribution (which can itself also be 
time-dependent). Extinction and speciation rates can be supplied 
independently, so that one can combine any types of scenarios for birth and 
death rates. The function \code{find.lineages} separates birth-death 
simulations into monophyletic clades so one can generate fossil records and 
phylogenies (see below) for clades with a specific mother species. This is
particularly useful for simulations with multiple starting species. See 
\code{?bd.sim} and \code{?find.lineages} for more information.

All birth-death simulation functions return a \code{sim} object, which is a 
list of vectors containing speciation times, extinction times, status
(extant or extinct) and parent identity for each species of the simulation.
We supply methods for summarizing and printing \code{sim} objects in a more
informative manner (see Visualization below). See \code{?sim} for more 
information.
}

\section{Fossil record simulation}{

The package provides users with a similarly diverse array of scenarios for 
preservation rates in generating fossil records from birth-death 
simulations. The function \code{sample.clade} accepts constant, 
time-varying, and environmentally dependent rates. Users might also supply a
model describing the distribution of fossil occurrences over a species 
duration to simulate age-dependent sampling. See \code{?sample.clade} for 
more information.
}

\section{Phylogeny generation}{

We believe it is imperative to be able to generate fossil records and
phylogenetic trees from the same underlying process, so the package provides
\code{make.phylo}, a function that takes a simulation object of the form 
returned by \code{bd.sim} and generates a \code{phylo} object from the APE
package. One can then use functions such as \code{ape::plot.phylo} and
\code{ape::drop.fossil} to plot the phylogeny or analyze the
phylogeny of extant species. Since APE is not required for any function in 
the package, it is a suggested but not imported package. Note that, as 
above, the function \code{find.lineages} allows users to separate clades 
with mother species of choice, the results of which can be passed to
\code{make.phylo} to generate separate phylogenies for each clade. See 
\code{?make.phylo} and \code{?find.lineages} for more information.

Note: If a user wishes to perform the opposite operation - transform a
\code{phylo} object into a \code{sim} object, perhaps to use paleobuddy for
sampling on phylogenies generated by other packages, see 
\code{?phylo.to.sim}.
}

\section{Visualization}{

\code{paleobuddy} provides the user with a number of options for visualizing
a \code{sim} object. The \code{sim} object returned by birth-death
simulation functions (see above) has summary and plot methods. 
\code{summary(sim)} gives quantitative details of a \code{sim} objective, 
namely the total and extant number of species, and summaries of species
durations and speciation times. \code{plot(sim)} plots births, deaths, and
diversity through time for that realization. The function \code{draw.sim}
draws longevities of species in the simulation, allowing for customization
through the addition of fossil occurrences (which can be time points or
ranges), and vertical order of the drawn longevities.
}

\section{Utility functions}{

The package makes use of a few helper functions for simulation and testing
that we make available for the user. \code{rexp.var} aims to emulate the
behavior of \code{rexp}, the native R function for drawing an exponentially
distributed variate, with the possibility of supplying a time-varying
rate. The function also allows for a shape parameter, in which case the 
times drawn will be distributed as a Weibull, possibly with time-varying
parameters, for age-dependent rates. \code{var.rate.div} calculates the 
expected diversity of a birth-death process with varying rates for any time 
period, which is useful when testing the birth-death simulation functions. 
Finally, \code{binner} takes a vector of fossil occurrence times and a 
vector of time boundaries and returns the number of occurrences within each
time period. This is mostly for use in the \code{sample.clade} function. See
\code{?rexp.var}, \code{?var.rate.div} and \code{?binner} for more 
information.

\examples{

# here we present a quick example of paleobuddy usage
# for a more involved introduction, see the \code{overview} vignette

# make a vector for time

# speciation rate
lambda <- function(t) {
  0.15 + 0.03*t
}

# extinction rate

# these are pretty simple scenarios, of course
# check the examples in ?bd.sim for a more comprehensive review

# diversification
d <- function(t) {
  lambda(t) - mu
}

# calculate how many species we expect over 10 million years
div <- var.rate.div(rate = d, n0 = 1, t = time)
# note we are starting with 3 species (n0 = 3), but the user
# can provide any value - the most common scenario is n0 = 1

# plot it
plot(time, rev(div), type = 'l', main = "Expected diversity",
     xlab = "Time (My)", ylab = "Species",
     xlim = c(max(time), min(time)))

# we then expect around 9 species 
# alive by the present, seems pretty good

# set seed
set.seed(1)

# run the simulation
sim <- bd.sim(n0 = 1, lambda = lambda, mu = mu, 
              tMax = 10, nFinal = c(20, Inf))
# nFinal controls the final number of species
# here we throw away simulations with less than 20 species generated

# draw longevities
draw.sim(sim)

# from sim, we can create fossil records for each species
# rho is the fossil sampling rate, see ?sample.clade
samp <- sample.clade(sim = sim, rho = 0.75, tMax = 10,
                     bins = seq(10, 0, -1))
# note 7 out of the 31 species did not leave a fossil - we can in this way
# simulate the incompleteness of the fossil record

# we can draw fossil occurrences as well, and order by extinction time
draw.sim(sim, fossils = samp, sortBy = "TE")

# take a look at the phylogeny
